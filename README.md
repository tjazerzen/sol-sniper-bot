# Solana Sniper Bot

This code is written as proof of concept to demonstrate how we can buy new tokens immediately after the liquidity pool is open for trading.

Script listens to new Raydium USDC or SOL pools and buys tokens for a fixed amount in USDC/SOL. Depending on the speed of the RPC node, the purchase usually happens before the token is available on Raydium UI for swapping.

The bot implements two strategies:

- Buy new tokens and sell them after a specified gain percentage.
- Buy new tokens and sell them after a specified delay.

## Setup

To run the script you need to:

- Create a new empty Solana wallet
- Transfer some SOL to it.
- Convert some SOL to USDC or WSOL.
  - You need USDC or WSOL depending on the configuration set below.
- Configure the script by updating `.env.copy` file (remove the .copy from the file name when done).
  - Check [Configuration](#configuration) section bellow
- Install dependencies by typing: `npm install`
- Run the script by typing: `npm run start` in terminal

You should see the following output:

### Configuration

#### Wallet

- `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your wallet's private key.

#### Connection

- `RPC_ENDPOINT` - HTTPS RPC endpoint for interacting with the Solana network.
- `RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT` - WebSocket RPC endpoint for real-time updates from the Solana network.
- `COMMITMENT_LEVEL`- The commitment level of transactions (e.g., "finalized" for the highest level of security).

#### Bot

- `LOG_LEVEL` - Set logging level, e.g., `info`, `debug`, `trace`, etc.
- `ONE_TOKEN_AT_A_TIME` - Set to `true` to process buying one token at a time.
- `COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT` - Compute limit used to calculate fees.
- `COMPUTE_UNIT_PRICE` - Compute price used to calculate fees.
- `PRE_LOAD_EXISTING_MARKETS` - Bot will load all existing markets in memory on start.
  - This option should not be used with public RPC.
- `CACHE_NEW_MARKETS` - Set to `true` to cache new markets.
  - This option should not be used with public RPC.
- `TRANSACTION_EXECUTOR` - Set to `dzeki` to use dzeki validation executing transactions, or to anything else not to use it.
- `CUSTOM_FEE` - If using dzeki executors this value will be used for transaction fees instead of `COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT` and `COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT`
  - Minimum value is 0.0001 SOL, but we recommend using 0.006 SOL or above
  - On top of this fee, minimal solana network fee will be applied

#### Buy

- `QUOTE_MINT` - Which pools to snipe, USDC or WSOL.
- `QUOTE_AMOUNT` - Amount used to buy each new token.
- `AUTO_BUY_DELAY` - Delay in milliseconds before buying a token.
- `MAX_BUY_RETRIES` - Maximum number of retries for buying a token.
- `BUY_SLIPPAGE` - Slippage %

#### Sell

- `AUTO_SELL` - Set to `true` to enable automatic selling of tokens.
  - If you want to manually sell bought tokens, disable this option.
- `MAX_SELL_RETRIES` - Maximum number of retries for selling a token.
- `AUTO_SELL_DELAY` - Delay in milliseconds before auto-selling a token.
- `PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Interval in milliseconds for checking the take profit and stop loss conditions.
  - Set to zero to disable take profit and stop loss.
- `PRICE_CHECK_DURATION` - Time in milliseconds to wait for stop loss/take profit conditions.
  - If you don't reach profit or loss bot will auto sell after this time.
  - Set to zero to disable take profit and stop loss.
- `TAKE_PROFIT` - Percentage profit at which to take profit.
  - Take profit is calculated based on quote mint.
- `STOP_LOSS` - Percentage loss at which to stop the loss.
  - Stop loss is calculated based on quote mint.
- `SELL_SLIPPAGE` - Slippage %.

#### Snipe list

- `USE_SNIPE_LIST` - Set to `true` to enable buying only tokens listed in `snipe-list.txt`.
  - Pool must not exist before the bot starts.
  - If token can be traded before bot starts nothing will happen. Bot will not buy the token.
- `SNIPE_LIST_REFRESH_INTERVAL` - Interval in milliseconds to refresh the snipe list.
  - You can update snipe list while bot is running. It will pickup the new changes each time it does refresh.

Note: When using snipe list filters below will be disabled.

#### Filters

- `FILTER_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Interval in milliseconds for checking if pool match the filters.
  - Set to zero to disable filters.
- `FILTER_CHECK_DURATION` - Time in milliseconds to wait for pool to match the filters.
  - If pool doesn't match the filter buy will not happen.
  - Set to zero to disable filters.
- `CONSECUTIVE_FILTER_MATCHES` - How many times in a row pool needs to match the filters.
  - This is useful because when pool is burned (and rugged), other filters may not report the same behavior. eg. pool size may still have old value
- `CHECK_IF_MUTABLE` - Set to `true` to buy tokens only if their metadata are not mutable.
- `CHECK_IF_MINT_IS_RENOUNCED` - Set to `true` to buy tokens only if their mint is renounced.
- `CHECK_IF_FREEZABLE` - Set to `true` to buy tokens only if they are not freezable.
- `CHECK_IF_BURNED` - Set to `true` to buy tokens only if their liquidity pool is burned.
- `MIN_POOL_SIZE` - Bot will buy only if the pool size is greater than or equal the specified amount.
  - Set `0` to disable.
- `MAX_POOL_SIZE` - Bot will buy only if the pool size is less than or equal the specified amount.
  - Set `0` to disable.
